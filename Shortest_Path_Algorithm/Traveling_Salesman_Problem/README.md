# Traveling Salesman Problem

* 'multiplearray.h' and 'multiplearray.c' is in [Data_Structure](https://github.com/RPF511/Data_Structure)
* in TSP, there is one answer and path it's circular. Since i wanted to write a code that can be used fluidly, i saved path to 'dual circular linked list' and can be printed at any point in any direction
